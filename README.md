# Recipe Book App

#### I developed a user-authenticated Recipe Book Android app using Flutter and Dart. The app allows new users to sign up and existing users to log in securely using Firebase Authentication. Once logged in, users can browse a variety of recipes and filter them based on categories such as breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Recipes are fetched dynamically using an open API, providing users with an engaging and personalized cooking experience.
